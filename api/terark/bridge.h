	 * --------------------------------------------------------------
	 * Inserting a new record after the current maximum record in a
	 * fixed-length bit field column-store (that is, a store with an
	 * 'r' type key and 't' type value) may implicitly create the missing
	 * records as records with a value of 0.
	 *
	 * When loading a large amount of data into a new object, using
	 * a cursor with the \c bulk configuration string enabled and
	 * loading the data in sorted order will be much faster than doing
	 * out-of-order inserts.  See @ref tune_bulk_load for more information.
	 *
	 * The maximum length of a single column stored in a table is not fixed
	 * (as it partially depends on the underlying file configuration), but
	 * is always a small number of bytes less than 4GB.
	 *
	 * In particular, if \c overwrite is not configured and a record with
	 * the specified key already exists, ::WT_DUPLICATE_KEY is returned.
	 * Also, if \c in_memory is configured for the database and the insert
	 * requires more than the configured cache size to complete,
	 * ::WT_CACHE_FULL is returned.
